React Hooks have fundamentally changed how we write React components. They allow us to use state and other React features in functional components, making our code more readable and maintainable.

## What Are React Hooks?

Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. They were introduced in React 16.8 and have become the standard way to write React components.

## Basic Hooks

### useState Hook

The `useState` hook is the most fundamental hook:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### useEffect Hook

The `useEffect` hook handles side effects:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch data when component mounts
    fetch('/api/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means run once
  
  return <div>{data ? data.title : 'Loading...'}</div>;
}
```

## Custom Hooks

You can create your own hooks to reuse stateful logic:

```javascript
function useLocalStorage(key, initialValue) {
  const [storedValue, setStoredValue] = useState(() => {
    try {
      const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
      return item ? JSON.parse(item) : initialValue;
    } catch (error) {
      return initialValue;
    }
  });
  
  const setValue = value => {
    try {
      setStoredValue(value);
      window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error);
    }
  };
  
  return [storedValue, setValue];
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Only call hooks at the top level** - Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
2. **Only call hooks from React functions** - Call hooks from React function components or custom hooks
3. **Use the dependency array correctly** - Include all values that the effect depends on
4. **Keep hooks simple** - Each hook should have a single responsibility

## Common Pitfalls

- **Missing dependencies** in useEffect
- **Infinite re-renders** due to incorrect dependency arrays
- **Stale closures** when using values from previous renders

## Conclusion

React Hooks provide a powerful and intuitive way to manage state and side effects in functional components. They make React code more readable, testable, and maintainable. By understanding the core concepts and following best practices, you can write better React applications.
