Node.js has become the go-to platform for building scalable and performant APIs. Let's explore the best practices.

## Why Node.js for APIs?

Node.js excels at building APIs due to:

- **Event-driven Architecture:** Handles concurrent requests efficiently
- **JavaScript Everywhere:** Same language on frontend and backend
- **Rich Ecosystem:** Extensive package ecosystem
- **Performance:** Fast execution and low memory footprint

## Essential Libraries

Key packages for building APIs:

- **Express.js:** Minimal and flexible web framework
- **Joi:** Schema validation library
- **Helmet:** Security middleware
- **Morgan:** HTTP request logger

## API Design Principles

Follow these principles for better APIs:

- Use RESTful conventions
- Implement proper error handling
- Add authentication and authorization
- Include comprehensive logging
- Write thorough documentation
