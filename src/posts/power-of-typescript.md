TypeScript has revolutionized how we write JavaScript applications, providing type safety and better developer experience.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript offers several advantages over plain JavaScript:

- **Type Safety:** Catch errors at compile time instead of runtime
- **Better IDE Support:** Enhanced autocomplete and refactoring tools
- **Improved Maintainability:** Easier to understand and modify code
- **Team Collaboration:** Better communication through type definitions

## Getting Started with TypeScript

To add TypeScript to an existing project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node
```

Then create a `tsconfig.json` file to configure the compiler.

## TypeScript Best Practices

Some key practices to follow:

- Use strict mode for better type checking
- Define interfaces for complex objects
- Leverage union types for flexible APIs
- Use generics for reusable components
