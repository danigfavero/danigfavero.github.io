# 🚀 Deployment Guide

Your Next.js app is now configured and ready for GitHub Pages deployment! Here are the final steps:

## ✅ What's Already Done

- ✅ Next.js app created with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Static export configuration enabled
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow created
- ✅ Code committed and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Build tested locally

## 🔧 Final GitHub Setup Steps

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository: [https://github.com/danigfavero/danigfavero.github.io](https://github.com/danigfavero/danigfavero.github.io)
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Click **Save**

### 2. Check GitHub Actions

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You should see the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow running
3. Wait for it to complete (usually takes 2-3 minutes)
4. The workflow will automatically deploy your site

### 3. Access Your Site

Once deployment is complete, your site will be available at:
**https://danigfavero.github.io**

## 🔄 Automatic Deployment

From now on, every time you push to the `main` branch:
1. GitHub Actions will automatically build your Next.js app
2. Generate static files
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages
4. Your site will be updated within minutes

## 🛠️ Local Development

To work on your site locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm start
```

## 📝 Customization

- **Homepage**: Edit `src/app/page.tsx`
- **Layout**: Modify `src/app/layout.tsx`
- **Styles**: Update `src/app/globals.css`
- **Configuration**: Adjust `next.config.ts`

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check GitHub Actions logs for errors
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
- Verify TypeScript compilation

### Site Not Loading
- Wait a few minutes after deployment
- Check if the GitHub Actions workflow completed successfully
- Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings

### Styling Issues
- Ensure Tailwind CSS is working
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the build output in the `out/` directory
